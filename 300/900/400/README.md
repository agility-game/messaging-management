# 400 - Setting Up MongoDB on Sliplane

To store all information that is transmitted through the messaging management system, a hosted MongoDB database instance is used.

The MongoDB database is hosted on Sliplane, a Software-as-a-Service that is a portal to Hetzner cloud hosting, making it easier to deploy applications.
